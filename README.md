# Take-Home Interview: Graffiti Graph

Residents of Chicago can request graffiti removal by calling 3-1-1. Your job is to build a dashboard that displays the number of graffiti removal requests by ward. (The City of Chicago is divided into 50 subsections called "wards".)

## Exercise Instructions

Your tool should interact with the City of Chicago's data API to retrieve the information needed. 

The data sets to use for this coding challenge are Chicago's graffiti removal request data set.

As a bonus, allow the user to input a month and year so that the dashboard only displays the graffiti removal requests for that period of time.
